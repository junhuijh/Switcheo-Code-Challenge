Hi Switcheo

I have initially applied for full stack to try the role.
However, after reading the guidelines on the Code Challenge notion site, I decided to apply for frontend.

Frontend questions would be 
problem1 - three ways to sum to n
problem2 - Fancy form
problem3 - Messy React form

Please ignore the other folders

For problem2 - fancy form
- I am using NextJs framework and shadcn library
- Please run these commands
    - npm i 
    - npm run dev
- go to localhost:3000 to view the fancyform
